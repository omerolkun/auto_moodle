It uses your e-mail, Bilkent student ID, e-mail password and SRS password and authenticates to SRS
with selenium. It only works with Bilkent mail. You also should be already receiving your
verification code as e-mail.

In order to use it, you should provide a *credits.py* file containing your login information. It
should contain the following variables:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
mail_adr = "YOUR_BILKENT_EMAIL_ADDRESS"
mail_p = "YOUR_MAIL_PASSWORD"

id = "YOUR_STUDENT_ID"
moodle_p = "YOUR_SRS_PASSWORD"
#+END_SRC

In order to run without modifications, you should have Chrome installed and computable chromedriver should be located on your path.

It is possible to define a keybinding for the program and easily call it.
